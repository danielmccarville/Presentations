# Presentations
This repository contains PowerPoint and other materials from my public presentations. I often use animation, so if a slide looks jumbled that's probably why. All presentations are labelled in the format yyyy-mm [Title].

Below is a brief summary of each file.

<ins><b> Managing Creativity and Innovation for GenAI </b></ins> <br>
Filename: [2025-03 Creativity and Innovation](https://github.com/danielmccarville/Presentations/blob/main/2025-03%20Creativity%20and%20Innovation.pptx)<br>
Creativity is the foundation for success with GenAI. Our biggest challenge isn't regulatory or technological: it's the ability to imagine new ways of working. This file includes:<br>
+ 3-part creativity model. Use it to understand why you are facing creative challenges and overcome them.
+ DISC personality model. Understand how your personality experiences creativity. Provides suggestions for innovating for each type.
+ Recommendations for managers wanting to foster innovation in their teams.

This was presented at the 2025 Greenskies Analytics GenAI mini-conference.

<ins><b> Simulation for the Auditor </b></ins> <br>
Filename: [2022-10 Simulation](https://github.com/danielmccarville/Presentations/blob/main/2022-10%20Simulation.pptx)<br>
Computer simulation is a technique for prescriptive analytics. It makes predictions about what will happen in hypothetical scenarios. Auditors can use computer simulation to test what will happens if their findings are implemented. This can be incredibly helpful for recommendations that come at high financial cost, or present unique risks (such as risks to public safety). This presentation provides:<br>
+ How computer simulation works
+ A case study of using computer simulation for an audit
+ A playbook for implementing your own simulations

This was presented at the 2022 Audit Analytics and AI Conference jointly hosted by the IIA, ISACA, and Greenskies Analytics.
